## Efforts for dealing with a "Post-Quantum" world
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography[Post-Quantum Cryptography] ("PQC") algorithms are those expected to be resistant to attacks by Quantum Compters

## What are the PQC Algorithms and why do we need them?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrdExQW0cs[Excellent video explaining the pre and post quantum algorithms]

## How likely is it that we will have to face Quantum Computers attacking our encrypted data?
- Consensus seems to be that Quantum Computers able to crack traditional encryption will exist in 10-20 years.
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12372[Paper claiming that today's 2048-bit RSA encryption might be cracked on a machine with "372 physical qubits and a depth of thousands"]

## Warning: some algorithms *Previously* thought to be "Quantum Resistant" are not

## Current state of NIST-certified PQC algorithms
- There are other algorithms that have not survived the NIST evaluation process. That is the point of the process.
- Details of the current NIST evaluation of potential PQC algorithms can be found https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography[here]

## CRYSTALS
- L is for Lattice, the basis of 3 of the 4 PQC algos, with "Sphincs+"" being the exception
