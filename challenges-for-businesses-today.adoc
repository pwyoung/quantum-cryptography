# Challenges that exist for businesses today, despite the state of Quantum Computing

## Store Now to Decrypt Later (SNDL)
- Threat Actors (nation-states, criminal organizations, etc.) are stealing encrypted data today in order to decrypt it in the future
- Experts say that could happen within 10-20 years
- Some people think algorithms, like RSA-2048-bit encryption could be cracked much sooner.
- https://siliconangle.com/2022/09/20/half-organizations-concerned-quantum-harvest-now-decrypt-later-attacks/[Many orgs are waiting for C-level mandates, a major security incident, and are not preparing yet...]

## Most researchers believe Quantum Computers will be able to crack current common encryption by the late 2030s.

## Current state of cryptographic algorithms
* Algorithms used by https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-support-178-dal/[one security-conscious vendor]
* Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
** Used as a stream/block cipher since it is cheap and easy to encrypt a block of data
** Support for AES exists in most major computer chips
** Not affected by known Quantum attacks such as Shor's algorithm, because
** it is similar mathematically to one-time pad (XOR) algorithm
** AES is often used with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode[GCM]
** Note on why (naively) writing your own crypto libraries is a https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/184305/why-would-i-ever-use-aes-256-cbc-if-aes-256-gcm-is-more-secure[bad idea]
* Triple DES.
** Is technically FIPS 140-2 compliant, but https://www.reddit.com/r/NISTControls/comments/jie992/is_3des_considered_fips_1402_compliant/[not recommended] or allowed in TLSv1.3
* Blowfish.
** https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/204374/is-blowfish-validated-against-any-standards[Not listed] in FIPS-140-2 standard https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search[approved algorithms] 
* Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA)
** Is popular, and used by default in TLSv1.3, but is known to be vulnerable to PQC

## Some folks seem to like some other PQ algorithms (regardless of NIST) for a few reasons


## Regulations

### FIPS
- As of 7/7/22, NIST announced 4th-round algorithms (which it is nearly ready to require)
- https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/fips-140-3-standards[FIPS-3 explained]
- https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/07/nist-announces-first-four-quantum-resistant-cryptographic-algorithms[summary]
- https://csrc.nist.gov/News/2022/pqc-candidates-to-be-standardized-and-round-4[details]
- https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/post-quantum-cryptography-standardization[NIST landing page on Post-Quantum Cryptography]
### FIPS-3 now relies on ISO19790 to specify algos
- https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfcrypt-fips-140-3-2/[FIPS 140-3 will now point back to ISO 19790 for security requirements]


### FIPS-3 modules
- https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/modules-in-process/Modules-In-Process-List[Modules tested for FIPS-140-2/3 compliance]
* AWS has a number of modules, such as its Key Management Service, under test for FIPS-3 compliance.

## Standards

### TLS 1.3
- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design-03[TLS 1.3 standard]
- 

## Vendor Support for possible PQC solutions

### Solutions come in a few types
- Use Physical Quantum solutions (e.g. BB84) to distribute keys
* The problems with this are many: limited range, only distributes keys, repeaters are vulberable to conventional attacks, etc.
- Implement Post-Quantum Algorithms
* The problem is that these are not finalized and rely on the hope that math algorithms in the future will not crack them
- *Use Symmetric keys of long length*
* This is the strongest encryption possible, but it recreates the problem PKI was created to solve - how to distribute keys
* This seems to be the way most people are going (see below)

### Hardware Vendor support
- PQC tech specialist components
* https://arqit.uk/ [Arqit post-quantum encryption toolset is embedded in Dell, and Fortinet]
* https://post-quantum.com/index.html [Post-Quantum VPN]
- Dell Hardware (with Arqit)

#### QKD (via physical quantum properties as opposed to PQC) has challenges
* https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/QKD/001_099/014/01.01.01_60/gs_qkd014v010101p.pdf[QKD standards paper, p6]
** " It is beyond the scope of the present document to describe how a QKD
network generates key material shared between distant nodes."
* This is about the fact that relays are needed for long transmissions and those might be vulnerable to conventional attacks.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution[QKD wikipedia]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography#cite_note-auto-15[QC wiki page discusses theories related to repeaters]
* https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/12/14/2573636/0/en/Arqit-announces-Technology-Update.html[IMO, this reads as: Arqit argues that its non-quantum symmetric key approach is just as secure as those that use Quantum physical processes, so just use symmetric keys]

## Note Adding PQC to TLSv1.3 is not trivial
- https://blog.cloudflare.com/kemtls-post-quantum-tls-without-signatures/[Cloudflare discussing removing pre-QC from TLS (handshake where RSA is used by default)]
- 

## What to do?
- Add PQC algos to TLS (and only use TLS v1.3)
* https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design/[standards doc for TLSv1.3 with PQC/Kyber]
- https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/risk/solutions/quantum-cyber-readiness.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:cyber22:eng:adv:090622:k0167620&gclid=Cj0KCQjw8e-gBhD0ARIsAJiDsaVB7ZeHogIIrVIzmAxVnEy7oKeZUrhfIFYlmUWNMEz94RG6O1ufCOkaAizrEALw_wcB[Good high-level discussion]
- Risk Assessment
- Regulations - identify which ones apply, what they are, and what they will be (given changing algos for example)
- Enable Agility - e.g. to transition to PQC PKI (evaluate HSMs and KMSs), stronger symmetric keys if needed, etc
