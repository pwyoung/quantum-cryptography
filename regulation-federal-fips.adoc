# FIPS

## Latest Standard

- published 03/22/19: FIPS 140-3
- https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/140/3/final[FIPS-3 at NIST]

## Scope

 "This standard is applicable to all federal agencies that use cryptographic-based security systems to protect sensitive information in computer and telecommunication systems (including voice systems) 
 ..."

## TIMING - NOW

From FIPS standard: "12. Implementation Schedule. This standard becomes effective six months after approval by the Secretary of Commerce."

Per link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-3#:~:text=other%20assessment%20regimes.-,Approval%20and%20issuance,effective%20on%20September%2022%2C%202019.[wikipedia]

- FIPS-3 was approved on 3/22/19, and became effective on 9/22/19
- all FIPS 140-2 validations will be moved to the Historical List on September 21, 2026

## FIPS IS REQUIRED BY ...

The following laws

- Section 5131 of the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996, (Public Law 104-106) and 
- the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347).

## Algorithms
### Approved Security Functionsâ€¦. include those that are either: 
* in (FIPS)
* in an appendix to FIPS
* in a document referenced by the FIPS 
* in https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-140Cr1[NIST SP 800-140C] as an Approved security function
* in https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-140Dr1[NIST SP 800-140D] as an Approved sensitive security parameter establishment method.

## TESTING

Will be done according to an ISO standard, available for purchase at ISO, with sample is https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:24759:ed-3:v1:en[here]

## Symmetric Key generation
* https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-133r2.pdf[SP 800-133 r2 - symmetric keys]
** https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-71/draft[symmetric key distribution]
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAND[True random bits can be generated by leveraging dedicated hardware (and other entropy sources can be added)]
** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set[AES support is built into most chips]

### Maybe we can/should use symmetric keys to establish keys (rather than using asymmetric PKI)
* https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-71/draft/documents/sp800-71-draft.pdf[Recommendation for Key Establishment
Using Symmetric Block Ciphers]
** "The authors acknowledge that most current key-management systems are based on asymmetric
79 cryptography (e.g., a Public Key Infrastructure). However, concerns associated with the projected
80 consequences of emerging quantum computing technology for the security of existing asymmetric
algorithms (see NISTIR 81051 81 ) suggest a potential for some organizations to reconsider and, on a
82 case-by-case basis, reverting to key establishment based on symmetric cryptography. "

### FIPS: Encryption and Decryption Using Block Cipher Algorithms
* https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf[Triple DES/TDEA]
** "After December 31, 2023, three-key TDEA is disallowed for encryption unless
specifically allowed by other NIST guidance. "
* https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf[SKIPJACK]
** "The use of SKIPJACK for encryption is disallowed. "
* https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar2.pdf[]
** "The use of AES-128, AES-192, AES-256 is acceptable for encryption and decryption
using the *approved modes* in the SP 800-38 series of publications."
